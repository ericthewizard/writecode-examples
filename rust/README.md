Here is the example of how to generate Rust code using codeit:


```python
from codeit import code

# Generate a Rust code snippet based on the given prompt
prompt = "Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list."
rust_code = code(prompt=prompt, lang='Rust', max_tokens=1000)

print(rust_code)
```

This will generate a Rust code snippet based on the given prompt with up to 1000 tokens and print it to the console.

Example output:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut list = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    println!("{}", sum_even(list));
}

fn sum_even(list: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    let mut sum = 0;
    for i in list {
        if i % 2 == 0 {
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    sum
}

// This code takes a vector of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list.
// The function sum_even takes a vector of integers as an argument and returns an integer.
// The variable sum is initialized to 0.
// The for loop iterates through the vector and checks if the number is even.
// If the number is even, it is added to the sum.
// The sum is returned.

```
