Here is the example of how to generate Python code using codeit:


```python
from codeit import code

# Generate a Python code snippet based on the given prompt
prompt = "Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list."
python_code = code(prompt=prompt, lang='python', max_tokens=1000)

print(python_code)
```

This will generate a Python code snippet based on the given prompt with up to 1000 tokens and print it to the console.

Example output:

```python
def sum_even(list):
    sum = 0
    for i in list:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += i
    return sum

print(sum_even([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]))

# The function takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list.
# The function first creates a variable called sum and sets it equal to 0.
# The function then loops through the list and checks if the number is even.
# If the number is even, the function adds it to the sum variable.
# The function then returns the sum variable.
# The function is then called and the list is passed in as an argument.
# The function returns the sum of the even numbers in the list.
```
