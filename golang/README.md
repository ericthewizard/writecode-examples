Here is the example of how to generate Go code using writecode:


```python
from writecode import code

# Generate a Go code snippet based on the given prompt
prompt = "Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list."
golang_code = code(prompt=prompt, lang='Golang', max_tokens=1000)

print(golang_code)
```

This will generate a Go code snippet based on the given prompt with up to 1000 tokens and print it to the console.

Example output:

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var num int
	fmt.Println("Enter the number of elements in the list:")
	fmt.Scan(&num)
	var list []int
	fmt.Println("Enter the elements of the list:")
	for i := 0; i < num; i++ {
		var ele int
		fmt.Scan(&ele)
		list = append(list, ele)
	}
	fmt.Println("The list is:", list)
	fmt.Println("The sum of the even numbers in the list is:", sumEven(list))
}

func sumEven(list []int) int {
	var sum int
	for _, ele := range list {
		if ele%2 == 0 {
			sum += ele
		}
	}
	return sum
}

// Explanation:

// In the above code, we have created a function sumEven which takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list.
// In the main function, we have taken the input from the user and stored it in a list.
// Then we have called the function sumEven and passed the list as an argument to it.
// In the function sumEven, we have created a variable sum which stores the sum of the even numbers in the list.
// Then we have iterated over the list and checked if the element is even or not.
// If the element is even, we have added it to the sum.
// Finally, we have returned the sum.
```

Note: this example returned + at the beginning of each line; no idea why, but I removed it
